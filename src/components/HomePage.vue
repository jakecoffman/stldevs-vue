    <h3>Hello world!</h3>
    <p>
      This is a site for discovering what open source work developers are doing in the Greater St. Louis region by
      harvesting public information from Github.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a user on Github has self-identified as being from St. Louis, they are included here. You may also log in to
      this site and request to be included if you are from St. Louis or identify as a St. Louisan.
    </p>

    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <p>
      There are over 1,000 developers from St. Louis on Github that have pushed to over 4,000 code repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creator of the sublime-text git plugin is from St. Louis. Another St. Louisan created a JavaScript CMS and yet
      another made a Dropbox-like sync tool in pure shell script!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have many talented and driven developers here and this site's goal is to show off our projects to the city and
      the rest of the world.
    </p>
